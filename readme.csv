Learning by watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYjZtU1-u9Y

(1) Step 1: Create a folder "C:/GitHub_Repository" which is used to hold all repositories I am going to create during the learning process.
(2) Step 2: Invoke “GitShell”
(3) Step 3: In git shell, swicth to "C:/GitHub_Repository".
(4) Step 4: create a subfolder "GitHub_VersionControl"
(5) Step 5: Under "C:/GitHub_Repository", [git init .\GitHub_VersionControl] to initialize repository "GitHub_VersionControl"
(6) switch to Tthe "GitHub_VersionControl" folder, one should see [master] in the prompt.

------------ above is the init commit ------------------

[git add .] 			to put files / changes in the staging area and seems like copy/duplicating files.
[git commit]			this put files/changes in local repository which reserve a snapshot
[git commit -a -m 'Msg']	a shortcut to combine [git add] and [git commit]
[git status]	
[git status -s]			show what modified in short
[git log]			versions
				if the the log is too big to fit the screen need to press [shift + + Z] to return to the prompt
[git log --oneline]		a short version of the versions			
[git diff]			show the difference before staging	
[git diff --cache]		show the differences in the stage area
